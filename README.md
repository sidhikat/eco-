# Eco-
An app, programmed using Swift through the XCode IDE, that encourages users to multitask efficiently and limits distractions. This is made possible through a task list designed to break down individual tasks and is integrated with a reward system that donates to partner charities (focused on the environment) when the user is not using their phone. 

Programmed and designed by:
